lg = base 2
ln = base e
log = base 10

All balanced tree are O(log n) as long as they kept balancing

AVL Binary Search Tree complexity O(log n)
Normal Binary Search Tree complexity O(n)

Understand Single Rotation Left

AVL do a few more rotation than RB Trees (insert and delete) -> 

AVL are better balanced than RB Tree
1. uses AVL when you need to search in a lot of data
2. used RB when you need to insert and delete lots of data
